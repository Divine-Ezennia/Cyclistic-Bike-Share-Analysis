## 🎯 Executive Summary
The goal was to identify behavioral "DNA" differences between Annual Members and Casual Riders to drive membership growth. Based on the 7-month data consolidation of over 1.97M records, the following high-level findings were identified:

1.  **The "Spring Surge":** Casual ridership increases exponentially starting in March, providing a prime window for seasonal marketing.
2.  **The Duration Gap:** Casual riders maintain session lengths significantly higher than annual members, who favor short, utility-based trips.
3.  **Electric Preference:** Casual riders show a 20%+ higher affinity for electric bikes compared to classic bikes.
4.  **Flow Patterns:** High-traffic "Start vs. End" stations were identified near recreational landmarks, pinpointing exact locations for physical membership advertisements and marketing assets (QR codes/Signage).
